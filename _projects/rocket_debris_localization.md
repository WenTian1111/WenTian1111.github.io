This independent research project focused on a novel and critical challenge: the safe and accurate recovery of rocket debris. I developed a strategy that utilizes sonic booms generated by falling debris to pinpoint its location.

### Technical Approach

1.  **Modeling**: The core of the strategy is built on optimizing WGS84-based tri-sphere and quad-sphere intersection models. This geometric approach allows for precise localization based on the time-of-arrival of the sonic boom at different ground sensors.
2.  **Implementation**: I employed **MATLAB**, specifically using the `lsqnonlin` function for non-linear least squares optimization. A novel traversal algorithm was also developed to implement a weighted least squares correction model.
3.  **Validation**: The entire approach was rigorously validated using Monte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrated a significant enhancement in localization accuracy and confirmed the necessity of using at least four sensor devices for reliable triangulation.

### Outcomes

The primary output of this research is a publishable paper titled **“Research on Multi-Object Localization of Rocket Debris”**. This work provides a robust and validated methodology that can be applied to real-world aerospace recovery operations, improving safety and efficiency.
