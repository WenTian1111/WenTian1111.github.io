I am an undergraduate student at **Southwest University** (a 211 & Double First-Class university in China), majoring in Animal Science. My academic and research interests are heavily focused on mathematical modeling, data analysis, and intelligent systems.

I have a proven track record in national and international mathematical modeling competitions, consistently achieving first-class awards. My research experience includes leading projects on trajectory modeling and machine vision for intelligent sorting, with papers and patents currently in progress.

My technical skills include MATLAB, Python, and LATEX. I am passionate about applying quantitative methods to solve complex problems and am actively seeking opportunities in research and innovation.

### Education
*   **B.Sc., Animal Science** (Sep. 2022 - June 2026)
    *   Southwest University, Chongqing, China
    *   Core Courses: Advanced Mathematics (92), Quantitative Genetics (95), Mathematical Modeling (96)

### Research Experience
*   **ESI-Curvature Modeling of Egg Trajectories** (Leader)
    *   Led a team to design and implement an egg rolling test rig, utilizing high-speed cameras and MATLAB for data analysis to model egg trajectory dynamics. The project is aimed for inclusion in the National Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program.

*   **Machine Vision for Coupled Egg Dynamics & Intelligent Sorting** (Leader)
    *   Conducted extensive literature reviews and laid the groundwork for developing advanced egg grading and recognition systems based on morphological and dynamic behavior.

*   **Research on Multi-Object Localization of Rocket Debris** (Independent Research)
    *   Developed a rocket debris recovery strategy using sonic booms by optimizing WGS84-based tri-sphere and quad-sphere intersection models. Employed MATLAB, including ‘lsqnonlin’ and a novel traversal algorithm, to implement a weighted least squares correction model.This approach, validated by Monte Carlo simulations, significantly enhanced localization accuracy and confirmed the necessity of at least four devices.
    *   Outputs: Publish the paper titled “Research on Multi-Object Localization of Rocket Debris”.
